    <h1>Sponge Pudding</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A syrupy basin pudding with a moist sponge and sticky sauce - a Great British tradition with retro charm</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>175g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
            <li>3 tbsp golden syrup, plus extra for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>a splash of brandy (optional but delicious)</li>
            <li>175g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>zest 1 lemon</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>clotted cream, to serve</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>STEP 1 - Use a small knob of butter to heavily grease a 1-litre pudding basin. In a small bowl, mix the golden syrup with the breadcrumbs and brandy, if using, then tip into the pudding basin.</li>
            <li>STEP 2 - Beat butter with sugar and zest until light and fluffy, then add eggs gradually. Fold in the flour, then finally add the milk.</li>
            <li>STEP 3 - Spoon the mix into the pudding basin. Cover with a double layer of buttered foil and baking paper, making a pleat in the centre to allow the pudding to rise. Tie the foil securely with string, then place in a steamer or large pan containing enough gently simmering water to come halfway up the sides of the basin. Steam for 1Â½ hrs. Turn out onto a serving dish. Serve with lashings of clotted cream and a little extra golden syrup drizzled over if you wish.</li>
        </ol>
